 Roslindale is a variable font created by the amazing David Johnathan Ross, as described within the website his project was my very second made website. My class at Univeristy of Massachuetts Dartmouth (Web Typography) suggested I did something more outside my comfort zone, and make a completely seperate color palette from my first business card project. I could definitely improve upon my skills and in a pinch I was very easily able to make a functioning website.

 # Challenges
 I was able to utilize VS codes co-pilot AI software to help assist and learn new code, as well as our amazing professor Laura Henderson, we had amble time and resources to recieve help on our projects.

 # Tools Used
 In the process of making this website we first made mock ups and drafts of how we wanted our website to look. Although my draft is much different from the final product, it goes to show the elements between the two and how they don't always cross perfectly, or sometimes as the process continues, tweaks and adjustments can be made to end up with a still decent project. The software I used was Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Github, and VS Code.
